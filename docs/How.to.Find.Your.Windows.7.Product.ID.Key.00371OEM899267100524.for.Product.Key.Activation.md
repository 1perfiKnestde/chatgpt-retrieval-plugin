If you have installed Windows 7 on your computer, you may need to activate it using a product key. A product key is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and not pirated. You can find your product key on a sticker on your computer or in the confirmation email you received when you purchased Windows.

However, sometimes the sticker may be worn out or the email may be lost. In that case, you can use a tool called [Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder](https://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/) to find your product key from your computer's registry. Here are the steps to do that:
 
1. Download and install [Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder](https://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/) from its official website.
2. Run the program and click on the Windows icon on the left side of the window.
3. You will see your product key displayed in the right side of the window. It should look something like this: 00371-OEM-8992671-00524.

5. You can now use your product key to activate Windows 7 online or by phone.

Note: If you have upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, you may not need a product key anymore. Windows 10 uses a digital license that is linked to your Microsoft account and hardware. You can check your activation status by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation.
  
To activate Windows 7 by phone, you need to follow these steps:

5. After you enter the installation ID, you will receive a confirmation ID that you need to enter on your computer. Type the confirmation ID in the boxes and click Next.
6. Your Windows 7 should be activated successfully. You can close the activation window and enjoy your Windows 7.

1. Click on the Start button and right-click on Computer. Select Properties from the context menu.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the window and look for the Windows activation section. You should see a message that says "Windows is activated" and shows your product ID.

3. If you have any problems with activation, you can click on the link that says "Activate Windows online now" or "Activate Windows by phone" and follow the instructions. You can also click on the link that says "Change product key" if you want to enter a different product key.
